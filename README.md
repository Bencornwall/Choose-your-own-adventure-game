# Choose-your-own-adventure-game
(python)

This is a text based choose your own adventure game where you get to, well, choose your own adventure! 
In it you play as a somewhat brave adventurer who was given a quest by a mysterious man at a bar. You run into perilous traps and enemys, and also not so perilous ones too.
There are 15 endings in total and 1 secret ending. to find the secret ending, just type the next number in the line, for example if there are 2 options type '3'.

Here is the document with all of the endings. It kinda spoils it and ruins the fun if you look at it before playing it so test the game out beforehand.
