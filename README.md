# Choose-your-own-adventure-game
(python)

This is a choose your own adventure game where you get to, well, choose your own adventure! 
In it you play as a somewhat brave adventurer who was given a quest by a mysterious man at a bar. You run into perilous traps and enemys, and also not so perilous ones too.
Please keep in mind that this is still a work in progress and there is a little debugging I could do here and there.
There are 15 endings in total and 1 secret ending. to find the secret ending, just type the next number in the line, for example if there are 2 options type '3'.

The following are things you need to watch out for:
  - Always put the correct syntax when typing (putting a letter instead of a number will result in an error)
  - There is no way to save progress (like save codes)
  - Finishing up aligning story line and names

All of these are planned to be fixed in the future.

Here is the document with all of the endings. It kinda spoils it and ruins the fun if you look at it before playing it so test the game out beforehand.
